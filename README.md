# ESP32-Serial-Recorder
A little program to record from the ESP32 in main purpose to train your AI with multiple sounds recordings

Just open on VScode:
-run Pip install to install the missing libraries.
-connect your ESP32 and install the .ino code.
-while Arduino is open, open VScode (i have issue to run the code on VScode if Arduino is not running).

Start recording!
